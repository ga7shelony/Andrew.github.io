    <h4><font color="Red">Description Of The Game</font></h4>
    <h5>The game is about a soccer ball is trying to reach the image of a club logo or players<br>,
    the player gets 1 point when he reach the image in level 1, 2 points in level 2.<br>
    After the player won the game he can click on the soccer ball and has to choose a maximum number <br>
    from the soccer ball can choose a random number. The game gets more difficult as the soccer<br>
    ball continue to reach an image of the player in each level. In level one, the player <br>
    loss if the soccer ball touches the red border and he have to restart from the begining. In level <br>
    two, if the ball touches the green border he would have to restart from the begining of level two.</h5>
    <h4><font color="red">Reflexion</font></h4>
    <h5>I created that game because i thought it is easy, challenging and fun. The inspiration was<br>
    that i love watch soccer games and i'am very familiar with club logo and Players.<br>
    A successful point in my game was to find the coding for that when the ball when touches the red <br> 
    border go back to when it starts. Another successful point was to find the coding for that <br>
    when it switch to a backgdrop for 2 seconds and then switches to another backdrop.<br>
    A big obstacle that faced me was how to make that when the mouse clicks on the ball it asks <br>
    is the maximum number and the player can enter it using the keybords and the the ball choose a random <br>
    number, i overcome that by researching for similar ideas in scratch projects untill i got the idea.<br>
    Another obstacle was to upload a music when the player loss it plays, i overcome that by also searching <br>
    for similar ideas in scratch game projects. If i had more time, i would include more levels more difficult <br>
    and would include a music plays when the player is playing the game.</h5>

   This means is that when the player is playing the game (the green flag is clicked) at the final level when <br>
   the soccer ball touches that image, the backdrop switches to inform the player that he won the game for 2 sceonds <br>
   and then switches to backdrop where he cam click on the soccer ball to get a random number.
